## The comparative analysis of Pattern Matching Algorithms </h2>

<p style="font-size: 24px"> Introduction</p>
<p> DNA is a polymer composed of two polynucleotide chains that coil around each other to form a double helix. The two DNA strands are known as polynucleotides as they are composed of simpler monomeric units called nucleotides.</p>

<p> Each nucleotide is composed of one of four nitrogen-containing nucleobases (cytosine [C], guanine [G], adenine [A] or thymine [T]), a sugar called deoxyribose, and a phosphate group. The nucleotides are joined to one another in a chain by covalent bonds (known as the phosphodiester linkage) between the sugar of one nucleotide and the phosphate of the next, resulting in an alternating sugar-phosphate backbone. </p>

<p> The algorithms that we will be discussing in this paper includes, </p>
<ul>
<li>Brute force (Naive Algorithms),</li>
<li>Knuth Morris Pattern (KMP) </li>
<li> Rabin Karp </li>
<li> Boyer-Moore </li>
</ul>

 <p>We will have a thorough discussion on these, including their application, Pseudo code, importance and problems with the algorithms. We will also discuss why KMP is also called a DNA sequencing algorithm and how it gives a match in less time.</p>

 <p> Some Advanced topics from the Literature Survey were also studied in terms of the algoritms performace </p>
